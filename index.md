|[Audio Multi-band Dynamic Range Compression Smartphone app](https://github.com/nasim-alamdari/Audio-Compression.git)| This project presents an educational tool to learn about how hearing aid compression fitting is prescribed from a signal processing perspective. An interactive web-based program has been developed based on the widely used DSL-v5 fitting rationale. This program can be accessed and used from any internet browser to generate the parameters of compression curves that correspond to the nine frequency bands used in DSL-v5. These parameters are then transferred to a smartphone in the form of a datafile to be used by a compression app, which operates as a virtual hearing aid, running in real-time on both iOS and Android smartphones. This educational tool was found to be very easy-to-use by signal processing engineers as no programming knowledge is needed for adjusting gain across frequency bands and subsequently running the corresponding compression curves in the smartphone app to appropriately compress input sound signals.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SIP-Lab/SIP-Lab.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
